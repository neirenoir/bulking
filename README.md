# Bulking
### A mod about mad gains
**Bulking** is a [Diet](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/diet) plugin 
inspired by [Spice of Life: Valheim Edition](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spice-of-life-valheim-edition),
written with the intention of making food more interesting and unique.

## Where is my health!?
**Bulking** introduces a harsh penalty to your default maximum health. You will
no longer start with ten hearts: now it's only three! But worry not, you can 
recover them, along with many more bonuses, by eating balanced **meals**. Not only
has your maximum health been reduced, but natural regeneration is also disabled. 
This may seem harsh, but eating meals will gradually restore your health cap, 
and now, just like in Beta Minecraft, you can heal instantly by eating
**snacks**!

## Meals and snacks
Foodstuffs have been divided into two different categories: **meals** and 
**snacks**. 

Snacks represent small, easy to eat pieces of food that are
usually easy to find; this includes things like apples, carrots, or sweet 
berries. Snacks are handy little things that will restore part of your health
the moment you finish eating them, so make sure to keep a healthy stack of them
in your hotbar, because you are not getting health back from anywhere else!

**Meals**, on the other hand, represent elaborate cuisine meant to be enjoyed
slowly, possibly at home or sitting next to a campfire. These will contribute
to your nutrition values, which will aid you in recovering your lost health, 
among other things! The default Diet suite offers various attribute boosts and 
long-lasting effects based on how diverse (or specialized) your diet is. 
Discover your favourite meals!

## Digestion
In addition to the contents of your stomach, your previous days' diet will also
influence your current status. If you go to bed with a full stomach, you will 
keep some of yesterday's nutritional values, which can help you break through
some of those higher nutrient requirements, or simply help you have a more
varied diet. The number of days that are taken into account and the importance
they have over the "theoretical maximum" are configurable. 

Furthermore, if you go to bed with a full belly, you will wake up feeling
better than ever! For the following 20 minutes (a Minecraft day), you will
enjoy a 10% to all stats thanks to the **Sumptuous Feast** effect. The
stats Sumptuous Feast boosts are configurable via a data pack, so you can
boost modded stats too!

## Configurable?
Yes, many aspects of the mod can be configured, one way or another. The health
penalty, the number of days that the digestion mechanic takes into account,
whether to keep the contents of your stomach after death... all of these can be
configured through **Bulking**'s settings system. Diet configurations are also
respected where possible, and the size of your stomach is actually an attribute 
you could modify with other commands or mods! In addition, whether something is
a snack or not can be configured via datapacks by adding the tag `bulking:snack`
to them.

## FAQ
### What if I ate a meal I didn't want?
You can eat Rotten Flesh to empty the contents of your stomach and clear your
status effects, but beware: it's nasty, and you could die of puke damage.

### Can I use this in my modpack?
Of course! It's MIT licensed! If you end up using it, though, I would love to
hear about it.
